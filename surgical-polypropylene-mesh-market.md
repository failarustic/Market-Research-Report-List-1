<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Polypropylene Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Surgical Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Surgical Mesh</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical polypropylene mesh market comprises two primary types: non-absorbable and absorbable surgical meshes. Non-absorbable surgical mesh is designed for permanent implantation, offering long-term support in hernia repairs and other procedures, while maintain structural integrity over time. In contrast, absorbable surgical mesh is intended for temporary support, gradually breaking down and being absorbed by the body, making it suitable for cases where short-term reinforcement is needed. Both types serve vital roles in surgical interventions and patient recovery.</p></p>
