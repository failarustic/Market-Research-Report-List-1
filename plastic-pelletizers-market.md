<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Pelletizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Cut</li><li>Dry Cut</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic pelletizers market is divided into two main types: wet cut and dry cut. Wet cut pelletizers use water to cool and transport the extruded plastic, resulting in smoother pellets and less dust but requiring additional drying processes. In contrast, dry cut pelletizers operate without water, relying on mechanical cutting, which makes them more suitable for materials that can degrade with moisture. Both types cater to different production needs in various plastic processing industries, emphasizing efficiency and quality.</p></p>
