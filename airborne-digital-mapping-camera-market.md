<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Digital Mapping Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Array Scanners (Pushbroom)</li><li>Area Arrays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Airborne Digital Mapping Camera market includes two primary types: linear array scanners (pushbroom) and area arrays. Linear array scanners capture images by moving along a flight path, using a continuous sensing line to create high-resolution images, ideal for large areas. In contrast, area arrays capture images in a single snapshot, utilizing a grid of sensors to cover the entire area simultaneously, which is beneficial for detailed imagery and rapid data collection in varying terrains. Both technologies serve critical roles in aerial mapping and geospatial applications.</p></p>
